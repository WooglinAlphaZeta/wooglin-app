<p class="const-text">Article Eight: Disciplinary Procedures</p>
<p class="const-text">Section I: In order for a case to be heard by the Kai Committee, it must be recommended to any Kai
    Committee member.
    A brother must be recommended for a Kai Committee hearing by a formal submission of the Kai Recommendation Form.</p>
<p class="const-text">Section II: A Kai Recommendation Form must be reported in the same quarter as the reported
    infraction was committed
    or discovered. If the infraction is reported or discovered during the final two weeks of the quarter or during a
    finals period, then it can be reported during the following quarter.</p>
<p class="const-text">Section III: Steps of Action:</p>
<p class="const-text">A. A Kai Recommendation Form is filed.<br/> B. The Kai Committee will convene and vote whether or
    not to hear the
    complaint. If the complaint is to be heard before the Kai Committee a copy of the Recommendation Form will be given
    to the accused. <br/> C. The Kai committee requests the individual(s) involved to attend a hearing. The hearing will
    be held during the quarter in which the Kai Recommendation Form is submitted, unless the Kai Recommendation Form is
    submitted within the last two weeks of any quarter or during any finals period, in which case the hearing can be
    heard during the following quarter. <br/> D. Following the hearing the committee members will deliberate, they will
    vote if the accused is guilty of the charges brought against him. If the accused is found guilty the committee will
    then decide on the sanctions. A report will be filed, with the Vice President of Internal Affairs, stating the
    innocence or guilt of the brother and sanctions or lack thereof that will be brought against them.<br/> E.
    Documented minutes of meeting procedures should be kept for future reference. A copy of the Ritual Book of Beta
    Theta Pi and the Alpha Zeta Constitution and Bylaws will be present at all Kai Committee Hearings to serve as a
    reference. <br/> F. Sanctions will be reported to the appropriate constituents, including Chapter Counselor,
    Leadership Consultant or District Chief depending on severity of violation, as well as situations that may be cause
    for Trial by Chapter.</p>
<p class="const-text">Section IV: If a member is convicted by the Kai Committee of more than three violations of the
    Alpha Zeta Bylaws or
    Constitution, then the Kai Committee has the authority to recommend that member for Trial by Chapter.</p>
<p class="const-text">Section V: Appeal Process: Any Kai Committee decision regarding a hearing can be appealed to the
    Chapter. The Chapter
    hears from the member(s) involved, and then hears an explanation of sanctions from a Kai Committee representative.
    The Chapter must vote whether it would like to hear an appeal, on whether the accused is guilty and then vote on
    whether sanctions given by the committee are justified, due to violations of the party in question. If 67% of the
    Chapter votes to change the sanctions then the Kai committee will redraft said sanctions. If the vote fails, then
    the original sanctions stand. If a second appeal is presented to the chapter for the same charge, and the chapter
    disapproves the decision, all sanctions for that charge will be dropped. A member can only appeal a sanction once to
    the Chapter.</p>
<p class="const-text">Section VI: If a member has to miss a hearing with a valid excuse, the Vice President of
    Brotherhood must be notified
    24 hours in advance.<br/><br/>Section VII: For possible Kai violations, see Appendix A.</p>
<p class="const-text">Section VIII: For possible Kai sanctions, see Appendix B.</p>

    the members of a chapter present at a chapter meeting.</p>
<p class="const-text">Section XI: The vote for a Trial by Chapter will be initiated and presented by only the Kai
    Committee.</p>
<p class="const-text">Section XII: The only way for a member to be removed from membership of the Alpha Zeta Chapter and

    is by a fair and complete Trial by Chapter.</p>
